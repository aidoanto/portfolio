### ==**Immediate benefits**==
==**Less repetition**==
The bot can summarise your community conversation to save you time filling out forms.
==**Quicker answers**==
While you wait for official support, the bot will suggest relevant guides and resources that might solve your problem right away.
==**Smoother experience**==
Our goal is to help you without making you jump through hoops between our community and official support channels.
==**Same experience for staff**==
Service agents receiving tickets would do so in the same way, with the same (or more) user information, and no workflow disruptions.

### ==**Feature Roadmap: Beyond the MVP**==
==**Content recommendations from our vector database**==
- While users wait for official support, R√òDEBot will proactively suggest relevant articles, videos, and community posts that have helped users in the past. This system would use our ==[[Footnotes]]==, so the system would understand the intent behind the query, not just keywords.
- For example, if a user asks, "how to make my mix louder?" the bot might link to a guide on ‚Äúadjusting levels‚Äù, even though there are no exact matches between those two phrases.
- If the content does help, they could close their ticket straight away.
The goal of this feature is that we could solve around 20% of queries before they even reach our service team.
