## Balancing Impact and SEO: A Case Study in Mental Health Content
During my tenure at ReachOut, I identified a critical gap in our content: ADHD resources for young people. Conventional wisdom deemed ADHD too "niche" and "specialist" compared to broader conditions like depression and anxiety.
However, using [[Optimising impact through content- my work for ReachOut]], I discovered that ADHD-related search volumes rivaled those of depression and anxiety combined. This eye-opening insight not only secured executive-level buy-in for the project but also shaped our content strategy.
### The Mission
My primary task was to **create impactful ADHD content that aligned with ReachOut's strategy and values**, while maximizing our positive influence on young people's mental health.
### The Approach
**Step 1: Extensive Research**
I dug deep into ADHD, looking at scientific studies, expert advice, and what young people were searching for online. This helped us create content that was accurate and useful. I found out what questions people had about ADHD and used this to guide our writing.
The end result was a practical and data-driven set of goals and best practices for creating ADHD content.
**Step 2: Strategic planning**
With this strategy in place, we were able to created a comprehensive ADHD section for our website. This meant thinking carefully about what to include and how to present it. This allowed us to balance formats across written articles, videos, Instagram carousels.
This strategic planning also helped to address our most pressing user needs, (i.e. high-volume search queries like “Do I have ADHD?”) while also leaving room for articles meeting our org’s desire for [positive, ‘strengths-based’ content](https://au.reachout.com/challenges-and-coping/adhd/learning-to-love-having-adhd).
**Step 3: Work with Experts**
We teamed up with a clinical psychologist, [Amy Burton](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Amy.Burton), fact check the articles we wrote, and also write some others herself. This helped make sure everything we wrote was correct and trustworthy.
**Step 4: Clear, Searchable Writing**
Our main article, ["Do I have ADHD?"](https://au.reachout.com/challenges-and-coping/adhd/do-i-have-adhd), is a good example of how we write. We addressed the questions people were asking, but explained exactly why diagnosis can only be done by professionals.
Amy’s authorship was crucial in making our content as helpful as possible and had the added benefit of boosting our SEO ranking (Google prioritises ‘trustworthy’ sources for sensitive topics such as these).
### The Impact
- Our ADHD module quickly became one of ReachOut's **top five performing pages** on organic search.
- The "Do I have ADHD?" article consistently ranks on Google's first page for related queries.
- We successfully expanded our reach to a previously underserved audience, providing crucial, ethically-sound information to young people questioning their mental health.
