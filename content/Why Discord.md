# Why is Discord popular?
---
### Changing attitudes in gen Z and gen alpha, particularly
- Half of Discord’s users are under 24.
- Clearly, they’re looking for more private online spaces compared to the big, public platforms like Facebook and Twitter.
- In recent years, this discourse has centered the rise of TikTok & shortform video. This is only half of the story – the other half can be found on Discord.

### ==Changes in views on content moderation==
- As those in the tech industry often note, **content moderation is hard**. It’s especially hard on unified global platforms like Instagram and TikTok, where platforms have to set one set of rules for everyone.
- Discord has global rules to prevent the worst kinds of behavior, but leaves smaller decisions up to individual communities. Additionally, the customisation features of Discord allow moderators to create helpful custom moderation tools. Users have a better experience in communities where moderation feels like it’s aligned to their sensibilities!

## Social that works for you, not vice versa
- **Make It Yours**: Since the death of MySpace, every feed and page on every social app feels the same! With Discord, you can add prebuilt tools or code your own to design a space that matches what your community needs.
- The most popular Discord server ever is [Midjourney](http://midjourney.com). In 2022, they realised that by using the developer tools on Discord, they could use their community as the frontend for their AI image generation startup. There’s more to their story than that, but it’s one example of how effective it can be to **put your service in the same place as your community**.

**Key Takeaway**
Discord isn't just another social network. It’s somewhere between a social network and a development platform. It gives you both community features AND the flexibility to create something truly unique.
If you make something meaningful, people will sign up just to use it! In our most recent promotional campaign, **around 25% of our signups joined Discord** just to visit our community. If you build it, they will come!
Users experience less friction joining a Discord server than a custom web community, but that doesn't mean you can just coast by. A successful Discord strategy still needs strong community builders who understand the platform.
