## ==Communities & AI: you need to create data in order to use it!==
Communities are the best way to generate knowledge at scale, full stop. Google seems to agree; they recently revealed [a new $60 million annual licensing deal with Reddit](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-reddit-60-million-deal-ai-training/) for rights to use the site’s data. Why? Because communities constantly create data that can’t be generated any other way.
- One of the most common types of questions we receive is something like “will this RØDECaster work with [some device I’ve never heard of before]?”
- Of course, these compatibility questions have always been hard to answer. Part of my job involves answering them! But our community is much better at doing this than I am.
- Products that have this data available (like ours) benefit from platforms like Discord existing, and lesser known products don’t.
Google & Reddit’s deal demonstrates that in the future, it will be a lot easier for LLMs to find, analyse and use data, but data still has to be created in the first place. That’s what communities do!

## ==How I learned to stop worrying and love the bot==
A large portion of my role at RØDE involves social media management – answering all of our community’s questions on **eight** social platforms. It’s worthwhile for our brand, but it’s time intensive.
Recently, I realised I was in the perfect situation to take advantage of recent advances in AI technology. I had the perfect use case, access to the best models, and all the data I needed at my fingertips. I had actually written a lot of that data myself, answering questions online!
After a bit of research, I realised the best available tool for me to educate myself on is RAG – Retrieval Augmented Generation.
==[[Footnotes]]== ==[[Footnotes]]====)==
On weekends and evenings after work, I taught myself to use a slew of tools like Python, MySQL, FastAPI, BeautifulSoup, and StreamLit, and built a prototype for RØDE using this technique.
**You can play around with it below!** 👇

Disclamer \#1: This was just a _**very**_ buggy proof-of-concept prototype. Disclaimer \#2: forgive the narcissistic branding, it was a personal project 😅

==**The issue with technology-centered design in the age of AI**==
After using the tool as a part of my social media management duties regularly, like many others using these tools professionally, I often found that using the AI’s writing was more trouble than it was worth. But it was helpful in a different way.
==**I just used it to ask myself this:**==

> _Where is that piece of information stored? Was that one in a blog post, FAQ, user guide, article, social post, or did I just write that in a YouTube comment as a reply to someone?_
I didn’t really care about the AI component of the tool, just the enormous ==[[Footnotes]]== database I had created. ==[[Footnotes]]==
I came to realise that despite how well versed in design theory and practices I am, I had committed an age old design sin: _centering design around technologies rather than user needs._
My next prototype met my needs much better: a simple search tool.

In the end, my time learning web data scraping, SQL database management, and Python app development was well spent! I use this thing everyday. Eventually, I hope others at RØDE and folks in the community will be able to as well.

### ==Could this system be used to analyse brand sentiment?==
==The tool above was d==esigned to collate all of our social media comments into a ==[[Footnotes]]==. This allows users to search the database using _natural language_ and find results that match the _meaning_ of their search terms.
Data scientists these days often use this exact same technology to perform sentiment analysis. It’s the same thing: ==[[Footnotes]]== can group phrases and comments with similar meanings across enormous datasets.
It wouldn’t be difficult to turn this to a tool that anyone at RØDE could use to:
- See what the worst feedback was about the Wireless GO II.
- See what patterns of feedback we receive across all of our products.
- Check if a certain bug has experienced seen before.
