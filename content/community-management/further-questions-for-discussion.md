### ==Idea \#2: Affiliate marketing within our community==
**O**ur Discord server organically merges affiliates and general users, creating a potential sales channel unlike typical affiliate communities.
==**Potential benefits**==
- Affiliates get direct access to potential customers.
- Users get authentic recommendations from fellow RØDE enthusiasts.
- Sales revenue could support community growth and moderation efforts.
==**Key question**==
How might we prevent spammy behavior that undermines trust?

Our users already convert lots of sales, just by being helpful.

==**Avenues for exploration**==
- Clear guidelines on when and where affiliate links are appropriate (focused on guides, helpful content).
- Moderation system to enforce guidelines fairly.
- Consider revenue sharing models to incentivize moderators and quality content creation.

## ==How can RØDE use our community to help us make better products?==
Big tech companies crave _data_, but RØDE needs _insights_. Our product & sales team can't analyze everything thrown at them from our users – there’s too much noise.
Community builders have a unique advantage. We can:
- Design targeted discussions, surveys, and feedback channels right within the community to surface the issues that matter most.
- Use sentiment analysis tools to filter out random complaints and isolate the recurring themes driving users' needs.

Our \#feature-requests channel provides helpful requests to our product team, along with data about how popular those suggestions actually are.
This approach ensures product decisions are grounded in real user pain points, not guesswork. This builds trust and fosters a sense that the brand genuinely listens.

## ==Community search vs brand search==
For brands that have them, communities can form a part of a _Unique Selling Proposition_ or USP. Even for slick brands, a strong community can be a major selling point. Users often go with the product or platform backed by the most active users. Why? If they have a niche problem, the community is more likely to have the answer.
Brands are usually reticent to promote community-written information, and rightfully so. What if it’s wrong or out of date? Or worse, what if it’s unmoderated and causes brand harm?
However, in 2024, one thing is for certain: **[users prefer community written information](https://weirdmarketingtales.com/why-people-are-adding-reddit-to-their-google-searches/)****.** They trust it more, they like it more, they use it more. Google just revealed they’re going to be paying [$60 million per year to have access to it](https://www.reuters.com/technology/reddit-ai-content-licensing-deal-with-google-sources-say-2024-02-22/).
So, brands with communities have a dilemma: they have really valuable data, but they feel it’s too risky to use directly. Could there be a middle ground?
What if brands were transparent about using community data? It's not about claiming everything is perfect, but framing it as a valuable resource with the clear caveat that it comes from the community, not official channels.

The new era of LLMs have taught us that users feel savvy about information that may not be accurate. They feel like they understand the advantages and limitations.
