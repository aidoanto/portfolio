title: 🏠 What I Learned Building the RØDE Community
---
 
> [!important]  
> “Hi! I’m Aidan. I wrote this case study to reflect on my first year working on RØDE’s online community. I also wrote it to share with my network. There is a lot of stuff here. You don’t need to read it all. Promise!”Info on this page is private – please don’t share with anyone else without asking first.
> ### Problem
> * RØDE wanted to develop a community around it’s brand and products. 
> Users wanted help with their products.
> ### The challenge
> * How might we build a community that aligns the goals of RØDE, and our users?
> ### Strategy
> * We flipped our thinking. Instead of dictating how our users should use the space, we just… did what they asked. 
> * We empowered superusers, streamlined the support experience, and made sure the community felt valued.
> ### Results
> * 12x membership growth in one year
> * 80+ support requests resolved per month from community members
> * High user engagement and a strong sense of positive brand sentiment.
> ### Key takeaways
> * Communities thrive when brands do the same things good leaders do. 
> * Invest in your helpful members, and they'll invest in you.

In my job interview with RØDE’s marketing team, I was told the department faced a unique challenge: they needed to build a positive space around the RØDE brand when most users arrived frustrated with product issues. It was a real head scratcher!
Mostly, marketing departments that try "community building" fail, because a community can’t be bought, or bossed around. Communities aren’t magically what brands say they are.

When I joined RØDE, ==[[why-discord]]== for marketing-related activities, like sweet livestreams, gaming tournaments, and community hangouts.
The idea was, it would be separate from our product support experience.
No matter how many reminders the previous team gave our users about this, we received dozens of service enquiries anyway. How could we enhance brand messaging, if _their_ only message was:

> _MIC BROKEN?!?_

When I joined RØDE, the “go away” strategy didn’t seem to be working.

### It was frustrating – they weren’t listening to me!
I’ll admit, when I first joined RØDE in March 2023, my thoughts really were this closed-minded about it.
Of course, as any designer reading this knows, the opposite was happening. _They_ were telling me what our community was for, and _I_ wasn’t listening.
  
## Communities want help, not hype?
Their behavior made sense! It’s often faster to ask enthusiasts on Discord product questions than it is to wait for a support team to return your email. The community’s collective knowledge reaches a lot further than the information in our user guides, too.
I realised that I could achieve ==[[why-discord]]==, if only I could just get them the help they needed.
Put bluntly, the community was asking us:

> _If you aren’t going to do the bare minimum by helping us fix the issues with your products, why would we hang out on your livestreams or participate in your giveaways?_
Most of the time as marketers, we create marketing goals to acquire users for a service. Instead, I realised I needed to provide a service to achieve ==[[why-discord]]==!
  
## Our pivot
We had to ditch the idea of the community being just for _our_ goals. Instead, we focused on what _they_ wanted: a natural way to get support, connect with us, help each other, and build relationships.
We believed if we provided our community with the ==[[respect-helpers-give-them-tools]]==, ==[[brands-compete-on-user-experiences]]==, ==[[respect-helpers-give-them-tools]]==, and leadership, they would have a positive experience, find the answers they needed, and stick around for our giveaways and livestreams as well.
