title: 🗺️ Creating a Meaningful Community UX (with Discord)
---
Need proof that custom Discord tools are worth it? We were able to bolster our affiliate program by developing a custom add-on:

**The Challenge**
Affiliates need support, resources, and a sense of connection to succeed. We wanted to provide that, even as we plan for this program to scale rapidly.
**Community Power**
We knew merging our affiliate network with our larger community would benefit everyone. But affiliates also needed a private space to network and receive affiliate-only information.
**The Solution**
We built a simple tool using the UpPromote API to automatically verify approved affiliates via their email. This granted access to exclusive channels within our server.
**Early Results**
In less than one month, almost one hundred affiliates have joined up, and the program was only launched publicly weeks ago.
This integration has already streamlined onboarding, strengthened our relationships, and contributed to a thriving affiliate program.
It’s also freed our partnerships team from routine relationship maintenance, allowing them to focus on expanding our network.

Email verification, as a low security barrier to limit access to affiliates only.

The affiliate community is located within the general server, strengthening both.
