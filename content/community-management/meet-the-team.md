title: 👋 Meet the team- one other guy
---

As we crafted our plan, we knew that there were a few limitations of the Discord platform which needed to be circumvented.

That required someone truly unique – a backend Javascript/Discord.js developer, an experienced community leader, able to approach messy problems with a fresh POV, who lived somewhere in the western hemisphere, so they could potentially handle emergencies if I was asleep!

## Enter Pablo Luna

@Pablo is a genius computer science student in the middle of his undergraduate degree at Universidad Nacional de Colombia, with years of experience working on the teams of hugely popular Discord servers and Discord software extensions. I couldn't have done all of this without him. He's always down to chat at yareaj@proton.me.

## Me (Aidan Molins)

Outside of the Discord part of my role I help manage, track, and analyze RØDE's social media and web presence, and respond to users and audiences.

Before RØDE, I was an end-to-end content and video producer at ReachOut, Australia's finest youth mental health service.

That role was all about producing thoughtful, impactful content safely, and surviving extensive stakeholder management procedures (but I came to love them).

Even further back, I hustled for clicks and shares by making videos, articles and graphics for Junkee, NOVA, and the Chaser.

**Other stuff I do**

- YouTube video essays
- Smash Bros Melee tournament commentary
- Improv comedy
- Learn Python for data analytics
