This chart just tracks data since July 2023 – that’s when we installed the extension that helps us track this data better. That big spike at the end was our most recent promotional campaign.

Additionally, this user & engagement growth has only required explicit promotion from the brand’s socials on two occasions, otherwise, the server’s growth has been through word of mouth, and static placements in RØDE’s Linktree and website.
In addition to membership growing, engagement has been growing alongside it.

## Improvements to our users’ help seeking experience
When I arrived at RØDE one year ago, my goal was to massively improve our users’ experience attempting to get help on our platform.
To do this, we created:
- ==[[respect-helpers-give-them-tools]]==
- ==[[respect-helpers-give-them-tools]]==
- ==[[respect-helpers-give-them-tools]]==
- ==[[respect-helpers-give-them-tools]]==
- ==[[respect-helpers-give-them-tools]]==
- ==[[brands-compete-on-user-experiences]]==
- ==[[respect-helpers-give-them-tools]]==

**Early results speak for themselves**
Eighty-one support queries were tackled in January 2024 alone! This extrapolates to potentially hundreds or even thousands of cases historically resolved organically within the community.
- While the place of gamification techniques in community design deserve further discussion in another piece, our approach has definitely worked thus far.

The number of messages in our product help channels, over time. In July, we switched from text channels to “forum channels”. There used to only be one channel per product, so in a text channel, you could only have one conversation about a product at a time. After switching, and implementing the custom features discussed previously, this volume massively increased.

### 🚨 **Subjective opinion alert (no data zone)** 🚨
I genuinely believe that since starting this plan, our brand image has improved. I’m biased, but I’m also the only one who looks and each and every word, image, and video which is posted about or in response to RØDE, everyday.
So, am I thinking of ways to test that hypothesis using more scientific methods? ==[[another-guy-making-chatbots]]==!
