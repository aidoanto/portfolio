### Loserfruit Comedy Sketch

This 🤳 [Y2K-themed comedy sketch](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CVjV07HDQsu/?hl=en) with [Loserfruit](https://www.instagram.com/loserfruit/), was one deliverable in a bigger project in our "COVID" strategy at ReachOut. Our internal research showed a clear insight, where the Loneliest young people during COVID were the ones who enjoyed socialising online the least. 

_ Note: You can see the post's performance using Instagram, above. However, if the Instagram embed isn't working you can see the full video backed up to ReachOut's YouTube channel below._

Part of our response involved giving young people resources to improve the quality of their online communication during lockdown periods when in-person hangouts weren't permitted. 

I produced this project and video from end-to-end, generating insights, planning and justifying a wider response, creating the influencer partnership with Kath and [Click Media](https://clickmedia.group/), testing the script and theme with our internal focus groups, writing and directing the video remotely, and all of the post production (including creating the music and 3D graphics).

### Work with The Chaser

Some 📹 [videos](https://www.facebook.com/thechaser/videos/534738730549184) I edited with [The Chaser](https://chaser.com.au/) to promote their show on [Triple M](https://triplem.listnr.com/sydney/), "The Chaser Report". Here's 📹 [another example](https://www.facebook.com/thechaser/videos/2797557310284831). I didn't write them, I swear! 😅

## 🤝 Best partnerships between community and content:

Here's a 🤳 [marketing promotion](https://www.tiktok.com/@rode/video/7341248335027784962?lang=en) we organised between our content and community teams, to engage our audience and drive engagement with our owned community platform (Discord). And here's 🤳 [another example](https://www.tiktok.com/@rode/video/7314188384925256961?lang=en) of our community content.

## 🍋 Most surprising success:

When I worked for NOVA radio, I was asked to create some "quick wins" to account for our team's shifting publishing schedule. With the goal of getting something online in less than an hour, I quickly took something I found on Twitter and put some inspiring stock music behind it. The 📹 [result](https://www.facebook.com/NovaPodcasts/videos/490990434671203) was a post that generated more engagement than at least 95% of videos I've created so far. 

## 😅 Most "wow okay this one found an audience":

This 📹 [meal prep video](https://www.facebook.com/NovaPodcasts/videos/1126118814217125) was another one for NOVA Radio. I genuinely wasn't expecting it to blow up, I really didn't know people hated their meal prepping results as much as I did.

## 📼 Best documentary:

A 📻 [radio documentary](https://soundcloud.com/aidan-m/thats-clown) I made for [FBi Radio 94.5](https://www.fbi.radio/)'s [All The Best](https://allthebestradio.com/) (nationally syndicated community documentary showcase) about [Philipe Gaulier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Gaulier), a clown who teaches at [his clown school](https://www.ecolephilippegaulier.com/) in Paris.

## ❤️ Proudest handling of a sensitive issue:

This 📽️ [video featuring Grace Tame](https://www.tiktok.com/@reachout_aus/video/7166082364056046850?lang=en) and this 🤳 [TikTok video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3_kxri7gJY) with my former colleague Justine Landis Hanley were part of [ReachOut](https://www.reachout.com.au)'s 2022 "Respect Project". I researched, planned and produced this project to respond to a trend we'd identified in our web data where, [starting in 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Australian_Parliament_House_sexual_misconduct_allegations), young people in Australia were searching in increasing amounts for our information on sexual violence online.
