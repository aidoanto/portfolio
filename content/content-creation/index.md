## Balancing Impact and SEO: A Case Study in Mental Health Content

During my tenure at ReachOut, I helped to identify a critical gap in our content: ADHD resources for young people.

Using [AHREFs](https://ahrefs.com), I discovered that ADHD-related search volumes rivaled those of depression and anxiety combined. This eye-opening insight helped to shaped our content strategy, and gave us key areas where we could create impactful, high quality content.

### The Mission

My primary task was to **create impactful ADHD content that aligned with ReachOut's strategy and values**, while maximizing our positive influence on young people's mental health.

### The Approach

**Step 1: Extensive Research**

I dug deep into ADHD, looking at scientific studies, expert advice, and what young people were searching for online. This helped us create content that was accurate and useful. I found out what questions people had about ADHD and used this to guide our writing.

**Step 2: Strategic planning**

With this strategy in place, we were able to created a comprehensive ADHD section for our website. This meant thinking carefully about what to include and how to present it. This allowed us to balance formats across written articles, videos, Instagram carousels.

This strategic planning also helped to address our most pressing user needs, (i.e. high-volume search queries like ‚ÄúDo I have ADHD?‚Äù) while also leaving room for articles meeting our org‚Äôs desire for [positive, ‚Äòstrengths-based‚Äô content](https://au.reachout.com/challenges-and-coping/adhd/learning-to-love-having-adhd).

**Step 3: Work with Experts**

We teamed up with a clinical psychologist, [Amy Burton](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Amy.Burton), fact check the articles we wrote, and also write some others herself.

**Step 4: Clear, Searchable Writing**

Our main article, ["Do I have ADHD?"](https://au.reachout.com/challenges-and-coping/adhd/do-i-have-adhd), addressed the questions people were asking, but explained exactly why diagnosis can only be done by professionals. It remains a great example of how we were able to succeed by meeting our audience in the middle.

Amy‚Äôs authorship was crucial in making our content as helpful as possible and had the added benefit of boosting our SEO ranking (Google prioritises ‚Äòtrustworthy‚Äô sources for sensitive topics such as these).

### The Impact

- Our ADHD module quickly became one of ReachOut's **top five performing pages** on organic search.
- The "Do I have ADHD?" article consistently ranks on Google's first page for related queries.
- We successfully expanded our reach to a previously underserved audience, providing crucial, ethically-sound information to young people questioning their mental health.
