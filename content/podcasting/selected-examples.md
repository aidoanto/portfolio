While anyone can edit a podcast, creating engaging social content that drives real audience growth requires a different level of craft. For *The Chaser Report*, I developed a series of promotional videos that elevated their show's comedy sketches:

![[geek_economy_banner.png]]

Commissioned by PodPaste to develop BunnyStudio's flagship podcast series, I created a show that positioned them at the intersection of technology, freelancing, and the future of work. This project demonstrated my ability to turn complex business objectives into compelling content:

#### Strategic Approach

- Developed a format that established BunnyStudio as a thought leader in the digital marketplace space
- Created episodes that tackle counter-intuitive questions, making complex economic topics accessible and engaging
- Built a content strategy that would resonate with both freelancers and enterprise clients

#### Selected Episodes

- **"Do barbershops and technology mix?"** - Exploring why some industries resist digital transformation while others embrace it
- **"Why should you hire a hacker?"** - Featuring cybersecurity journalists and Europe's largest bug bounty firm
- **"1UP: What makes or breaks a video game?"** - Investigating opportunities in the gaming industry's new economy
- **"Is creating animated characters overpriced?"** - Examining how remote work and digital platforms are democratizing animation

Creating this series, I effectively:

- Sparked discussions about the future of digital marketplaces
- Reached out to, and recruited high-level guests from BunnyStudio's key audience segments in gaming, tech, ads, and animation
- Created engaging narratives around BunnyStudio's core business propositions
- Positioned the company as a key voice in the growing gig economy space

### Housewarming at OWeek - Social-First Video Podcast Content
*With Marty Smiley (ABC, SBS) & Nat Damena*

When Marty Smiley needed a promotion strategy for his new podcast, I didn't just record an episode ‚Äì I reimagined how podcast content could work on Instagram. Shot on location at the University of Sydney's O-Week:

- Directed multi-camera setup for maximum editing flexibility
- Created custom graphics package using show's existing assets
- Edited for Instagram Reels' unique pacing requirements
- Demonstrated how podcast content can be optimized for social platforms

### That's Clown - Radio Documentary
*FBi Radio 94.5 / All The Best*

A deep-dive documentary exploring the world of Philippe Gaulier's infamous clown school in Paris. Features interviews with graduates Tom Walker and Penny Greenhalgh, examining the controversial "Whiplash approach" to teaching comedy.

This piece demonstrates my ability to weave complex narratives while maintaining audience engagement:

- Nationally syndicated across community radio
- Balanced serious documentary techniques with comedic elements
- Created compelling audio storytelling without relying on visual elements

### Frugal Forever
*Independent Production*

![[frugal_forever.png]]

Produced and strategized this independent podcast from concept to acquisition:

- Guided hosts in developing their on-air presence and content strategy
- Reached Top 20 on Apple Podcast charts through organic growth
- Secured publishing deal with Junkee for seasons two and three
- Handled full production suite: recording, editing, mixing and mastering

*Note: These episodes were recorded before I had access to professional equipment. While audio quality reflects this, I think the show's rapid success demonstrates the strength of the content strategy and production approach.*
